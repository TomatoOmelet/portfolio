    It is a 2D platformer game about a dog. I joined this project in \
    the middle, so I spent much time reading and understanding existing \
    code when I need to touch or use them.\
    \n\n\
    Although it is a 2D platformer game, the mechanic is already \
    implemented when I joined the team. I worked on things like the save \
    system, dialogue system and cutscenes. I also made the UI to create \
    and select save file at Main Menu. For the dialogue system, I serialized \
    text information to json files to make it easier for localization if we want\
    to do that in the future. I also modified the timeline in Unity to create \
    dialogue tracks and made the cutscenes for this game. My teammates \
    are skillful at their fields, and I had a good experience working on this\
    project."

    This is the project for the Capstone class I am taking at UC Irvine. The \
    most enjoyable work I have done during this project are the map \
    generation and a few shaders.\
    \n\n\
    It is a roguelike game, so we want to procedurally generate the map. I \
    read about how other roguelike games generate their maps, and then \
    made a map generator that fits our design. The map consists of map \
    pieces of different sizes, and we populate the items inside each map \
    piece to add more randomness to the game.\
    \n\n\
    Since I was learning about shaders, I also tried to write some shaders\
    for the project. I used dissolve shader, fresnel shader and stencil \
    buffer during this project. This may not be a lot, but I had a\
    fun time writing them."

    This is a card game about lobsters! We have been working on this \
    project for a whole month and I am working on the battle system. \
    I have never maken digital card games before, so I enjoy programming \
    this game.\
    \n\n\
    The first thing I tried to implement is dragging the card to floor. \
    I used raycast to check what player touches when they press down and \
    release mouse, so I can know if they are clicking a card and if they \
    are dragging it to a spot on the floor. Later there are more things \
    to check, like commanding lobsters to attack/denfense and choosing \
    targets/materials. I add variables to store the current states of \
    the game and test different stuffs when player press down/release \
    mouse button at different states."

    Most members in my team have made too many 2d games, so we end up \
    making a 3d game for the global game jam. The theme was a tough one, \
    \"What does home make you feel\". Our designer was also a writer, so we \
    ended up making this narrative game.\
    \n\n\
    Other programmers were concentrating on tech art, so I programmed a \
    bunch of stuffs including player movement, player camera, cutscenes, \
    picking up items, playing voice, displaying subtitles..... I kinda got\
    interested in shader after this game jam seeing my teammates doing it\
    and I plan to learn it too when I have time."
