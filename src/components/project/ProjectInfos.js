    It is a 2D platformer game about a dog. I joined this project in \
    the middle, so I spent much time reading and understanding existing \
    code when I need to touch or use them.\
    <br>\
    Although it is a 2D platformer game, the mechanic is already \
    implemented when I joined the team. I worked on things like the save \
    system, dialogue system and cutscenes. I also made the UI to create \
    and select save file at Main Menu. For the dialogue system, I serialized \
    text information to json files to make it easier for localization if we want\
    to do that in the future. I also modified the timeline in Unity to create \
    dialogue tracks and made the cutscenes for this game. My teammates \
    are skillful at their fields, and I had a good experience working on this\
    project."
